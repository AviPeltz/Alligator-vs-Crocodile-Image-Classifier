# Alligator-vs-Crocodile-Image-Classifier
Used Pytorch and Fast.ai libraries to make an American Alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) vs American Crocodile (Crocodylus acutus) image classifier with ~87% accuracy. The well documented nature of this notebook cannot be attributed
me, all credit should go to Jeremy Howard and the Fast.ai team as this model is a product of one of the Fast.ai Deep
Learning course lessons.
